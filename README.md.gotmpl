# CTFd Helm Chart
{{ template "chart.badgesSection" . }}

This is a Helm chart for deploying CTFd on Kubernetes. It is deploys the official [CTFd Docker image](ghcr.io/ctfd/ctfd). Supports HA and Autoscaling.

## Installation

Build helm dependencies (Redis and MariaDB) before installing the chart.

```bash
helm dependency update
```

Set the values in `values.yaml` to your desired configuration. You can also use the `--set` flag to override values during installation.

```bash
helm install ctfd . -f values.yaml --create-namespace --namespace ctfd
```

## Uninstallation
```bash
helm uninstall ctfd --namespace ctfd
```

## Features

- [x] HA and horizontal autoscaling with CPU and memory metrics
- [x] Configurable CPU/memory requests and limits

- [ ] Deploys postgres db as a helm dependency

## To Do

- [ ] Performance testing to verify autoscaling capabilities + e2e testing for verification
- [x] Fine tune cpu/mem requests and limits
- [ ] Chaos testing to verify HA capabilities
- [x] Add Pod Disruption budget (Added a rolling update strategy instead)
- [ ] Security testing to verify deployment security
- [x] Helm linting and testing with GitHub Actions (status badge remaining)
- [ ] Publish Helm chart to Artifact Hub
- [x] Custom NOTES.txt (post-installation message)

- Redis in this chart uses single master with multiple workers.
